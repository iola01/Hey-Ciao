### Hey Ciao,

## 🌱 About Me
My name is Artiola, and I’m at the beginning of a long and exciting journey in the IT field. With a strong background in customer service and hospitality, I’ve always loved solving problems, helping people, and learning new things.
I've always been interested in security and computers, but I never imagined I could actually work in this field. Now, seeing how much it's growing, I feel inspired to take the leap and turn my hobby into a career.
Right now, I’m exploring Active Directory, working with virtual machines, and even taking computers apart and putting them back together. I keep studying, and with IT, I’m never bored. What started as curiosity has turned into a real passion. I’m constantly learning, breaking things, fixing them again, and growing step by step. Every lab I build teaches me something new—and I genuinely enjoy the process.

## 🛠 Current Skills & Tools

Operating Systems: Windows, Linux (currently learning more on my Raspberry Pi)

Windows Server: Building virtual environments using VirtualBox

I’m eager to dive deeper into PowerShell, Linux, and cybersecurity as I grow.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

## 🎯 Goals & Vision
My goal is to break into the IT field and grow into a role that combines analysis and protection. I’m working toward becoming a cybersecurity analyst, and I’m especially drawn to environments where I can keep learning and help others along the way.
